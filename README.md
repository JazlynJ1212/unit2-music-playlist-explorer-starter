### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the book lovers lab that involved the creation of the different book reviews was very helpful as well as using another file to import data.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would add more css styling to the modal and the featured playlist tab.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

My project demo was okay, I should have spent more time walking through the features. I noticed the shadowing and hovering features my peers had that I may try to add next time.
